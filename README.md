**Organizations**
- [BD Fragments](https://github.com/BDFragments) - An organization specialized on creating snippets for Discord.
- [BD Styles](https://github.com/BDStyles) - An organization specialized on creating styles or **themes** for Discord.

**Repos**
- Most of my repos are on my [primary organization](https:/github.com/BDFragments) where I upload snippets.
- Others might be on my [secondary organization](https://github.com/BDStyles) where I upload themes, don't count on me to make a theme everyday as these take time and effort.
